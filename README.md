Code for PCA and ISOMAP written in octave.
It was done as an assignment problem (Dimensionality Reduction) as part of my 
coursework.


Refer: http://isomap.stanford.edu/ to know more about ISOMAP. 
This code is heavily influenced from their implementation.


You can start with main.m

Run: octave -q main.m swiss3D.txt

swiss3D.txt is an example dataset (Classic example used in ISOMAP)
